Java has a rich ecosystem of modern frameworks that are widely used for enterprise development. One of the most prominent frameworks is Spring Boot, which simplifies the process of creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It is known for its ability to handle complex configurations and its support for microservices architecture.

Apart from Spring Boot, there are several other modern Java frameworks that you can consider:

1. **Micronaut**: A framework designed for building modular, easily testable microservice applications. It provides fast startup times and low memory consumption.

2. **Quarkus**: Optimized for Kubernetes, this framework is designed to work with GraalVM to provide native executable binaries, making it a strong contender for cloud-native applications.

3. **Dropwizard**: Focuses on creating RESTful web services with minimal configurations. It bundles stable, mature libraries to provide a robust platform for developing web applications.

4. **Vert.x**: An event-driven, non-blocking toolkit that runs on the JVM. It is particularly well-suited for high concurrency applications.

5. **Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE)**: Provides a set of specifications that extend the Java SE with specifications for enterprise features such as distributed computing and web services.

These frameworks offer various features and capabilities that can cater to different requirements in modern Java application development. Each has its strengths, so the choice would depend on the specific needs of your project, such as performance, scalability, or ease of integration with existing systems.
