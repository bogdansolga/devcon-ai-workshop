Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field that encompasses a variety of components and technologies. The core components of AI and their interrelations can be summarized as follows:

1. **Machine Learning (ML):**
    - **Supervised Learning:** Involves training a model on labeled data, where the correct output is known. It's used for tasks like classification and regression.
    - **Unsupervised Learning:** Involves training on data without labeled responses, used for clustering and association tasks.
    - **Reinforcement Learning:** Involves training models to make sequences of decisions by rewarding desired behaviors and punishing undesired ones.
    - **Deep Learning:** A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in data.

2. **Neural Networks:**
    - **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs):** The foundation of deep learning, consisting of nodes (neurons) organized in layers (input, hidden, output).
    - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images.
    - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Designed for sequential data, useful in time series analysis and natural language processing (NLP).

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
    - Focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language.
    - Involves tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation.

4. **Computer Vision:**
    - Enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data from the world.
    - Involves tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and video analysis.

5. **Robotics:**
    - Combines AI with physical machines (robots) to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.
    - Involves perception, decision-making, and action.

6. **Expert Systems:**
    - Computer systems that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert.
    - Use rule-based systems to solve complex problems.

7. **Fuzzy Logic:**
    - A form of many-valued logic that deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than fixed and exact.
    - Useful in systems that need to handle uncertainty and vagueness.

8. **Knowledge Representation and Reasoning:**
    - Involves how to represent information about the world in a form that a computer system can utilize to solve complex tasks.

9. **Cognitive Computing:**
    - Mimics human thought processes in a computerized model.
    - Focuses on self-learning systems that use data mining, pattern recognition, and natural language processing.

The relationships between these components are often integrative, where advancements in one area can enhance capabilities in others. For instance, improvements in neural network architectures (deep learning) have significantly boosted the performance of computer vision and NLP applications. Similarly, machine learning techniques are foundational to developing expert systems and improving robotics. The interconnectedness of these components drives continuous innovation and application across various domains.
