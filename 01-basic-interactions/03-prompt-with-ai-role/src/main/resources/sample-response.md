Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC) are two related concepts in software engineering, particularly within the context of object-oriented programming and are central features of frameworks like Spring.

### Inversion of Control (IoC)

Inversion of Control is a design principle used to reverse the traditional flow of control in program execution. In traditional programming, the custom code is responsible for calling library code. However, with IoC, the framework or container takes control of the flow, and it is responsible for instantiating and managing the lifecycle of objects.

Key characteristics of IoC include:
- **Control Reversal**: Instead of the application code controlling the flow, the framework or container does.
- **Decoupling**: By allowing a framework to handle the object lifecycle and dependencies, applications become more modular and easier to manage.
- **Flexibility and Maintainability**: IoC facilitates easier testing and maintenance by reducing direct dependencies between components.

### Dependency Injection (DI)

Dependency Injection is a specific design pattern and a technique to implement IoC. It refers to the process of supplying an external dependency (object) to a software component. Instead of the component creating the dependency it needs, the dependency is injected into it, usually by a framework or container.

Key aspects of DI include:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Components are not responsible for managing their dependencies, which leads to cleaner and more maintainable code.
- **Types of Injection**: There are primarily three types of dependency injection:
    - **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
    - **Setter Injection**: Dependencies are provided through setter methods.
    - **Field Injection**: Dependencies are injected directly into fields (less recommended due to issues with immutability and testing).
- **Testability**: Since dependencies can be injected, it becomes easier to mock or stub these dependencies during unit testing.

### Relationship between IoC and DI

- **IoC as a Broader Concept**: IoC is a broader principle that can be implemented in various ways, such as through service locators, events, or dependency injection.
- **DI as a Means to Implement IoC**: Dependency Injection is a pattern used to achieve IoC. It allows for the external provision of dependencies, thereby giving control over to a framework or container.
- **Framework Support**: In frameworks like Spring, IoC is the overarching principle, and DI is the mechanism through which IoC is achieved. The Spring container manages the lifecycle and configuration of application objects, injecting dependencies where needed.

In summary, IoC is about relinquishing control to a framework, and DI is a pattern for providing the necessary dependencies to components, thus implementing IoC. This leads to more flexible, testable, and maintainable code.
